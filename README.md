## My Projects

### [Fig](https://github.com/auzon/fig)
Fig is an example repository to start your web tests using the BDD approach. It uses a combination of Python, pytest, pytest-bdd, Selenium, and the page object model. While there are other modules and patterns available, these constructs form the core of the repository. You can expand upon it and use it in your own projects.

### [Base Calculator](https://github.com/auzon/base-calculator)
Convert between decimal, binary, and hex.

### [Phrasis](https://github.com/YO-0-Productions/Phrasis)
Phrasis is a voice-controlled game developed as a graduation project.

### [Word Game](https://github.com/auzon/WordGame)
Word Game is a simple mobile word game inspired by the popular Turkish TV competition show "Kelime Oyunu". I didn't polish this game much because I lost interest in the project.
