# My Projects

## Fig

[Fig](https://github.com/auzon/fig) is an example repository to start your web tests using BDD approach. It uses the combination of python, pytest, pytest-bdd, selenium and page object model. There are ofcourse other modules and patterns exist but these constructs the core of the repository. You can expand upon it and use it in your own projects. I will change and add new stuff to this so it will be better overtime.
